# Pomodoro logger

A little tool I use to log my [Pomodoro-s](http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/). Literally, a one button interface: click to register a completed 25-minute session of uninterrupted work. Shows how many Pomodoro-s completed, and when was completed the last one of them.

To use, open `src/widget.html` in your browser.
